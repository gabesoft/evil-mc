** Multiple cursors implementation for evil-mode
*** Synopsis
*evil-mc* provides multiple cursors functionality for Emacs when used with *evil-mode* 
*** Usage
Start with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (require 'evil-mc)
#+END_SRC
**** Local Setup
To enable or disable *evil-mc* mode for a single buffer use:\\
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-mc-mode  1) ;; enable
(evil-mc-mode -1) ;; disable
#+END_SRC
**** Global Setup
To enable or disable *evil-mc* mode for all buffers use:\\
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-evil-mc-mode  1) ;; enable
(global-evil-mc-mode -1) ;; disable
#+END_SRC
**** Basic Usage
The main commands used to create or delete cursors are:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-mc-make-all-cursors)
;; Create cursors for all strings that match the selected 
;; region or the symbol under cursor.

(evil-mc-undo-all-cursors)
;; Remove all cursors.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-next-match)
;; Make a cursor at point and go to the next match of the 
;; selected region or the symbol under cursor.

(evil-mc-skip-and-goto-next-match)
;; Go to the next match of the selected region or the symbol under 
;; cursor without creating a cursor at point.
#+END_SRC

The above commands as well as others, detailed below, are setup with key bindings
when the *evil-mc* mode is enabled. The keys are defined in ~evil-mc-key-map~. You can 
take a look at that variable declaration in [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc/blob/master/evil-mc.el][evil-mc.el]] to see all key bindings. But,
in short, ~C-n~ / ~C-p~ are used for creating cursors, and ~M-n~ / ~M-p~
are used for cycling through cursors. The commands that create cursors wrap around; but, 
the ones that cycle them do not. 
To skip creating a cursor forward use ~C-t~ or ~grn~ and backward ~grp~. 
Finally use ~gru~ to remove all cursors.

For an example of setting up *evil-mc* see this [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc/blob/master/evil-mc-setup.el][setup file]]
**** Commands
Here's a detailed list of all commands used to create, navigate through, or delete cursors:\\
/All the commands below assume that there is a real cursor and possibly some fake cursors./

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-mc-make-all-cursors)
;; Make a cursor for every match of the selected region or the symbol at point.

(evil-mc-undo-all-cursors)
;; Remove all cursors.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-next-match)
;; Make a cursor at point, and go to the next match of the 
;; selected region or the symbol at point.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-prev-match)
;; Make a cursor at point, and go to the previous match of the 
;; selected region or the symbol at point.

(evil-mc-skip-and-goto-next-match)
;; Go to the next match of the selected region or symbol at point
;; without making a cursor at point. This command can be used to
;; remove unwanted cursors.

(evil-mc-skip-and-goto-prev-match)
;; Go to the previous match of the selected region or symbol at point
;; without making a cursor at point. This command can be used to
;; remove unwanted cursors.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-prev-cursor)
;; Make a cursor at point and move point to the cursor
;; closest to it when searching backwards.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-next-cursor)
;; Make a cursor at point and move point to the cursor
;; closest to it when searching forwards.

(evil-mc-skip-and-goto-prev-cursor)
;; Move point to the cursor closest to it when searching backwards
;; without making a cursor at point. This command can be used to
;; remove unwanted cursors.

(evil-mc-skip-and-goto-next-cursor)
;; Move point to the cursor closest to it when searching forwards
;; without making a cursor at point. This command can be used to
;; remove unwanted cursors.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-first-cursor)
;; Make a cursor at point and move point to the cursor at the first position.

(evil-mc-make-and-goto-last-cursor)
;; Make a cursor at point and move point to the cursor at the last position.

(evil-mc-make-cursor-here)
;; Create a cursor at point. This command should be used with `evil-mc-pause-cursors'.

(evil-mc-pause-cursors)
;; Pause all fake cursors. This can be used with `evil-mc-make-cursor-here'

(evil-mc-resume-cursors)
;; Call to resume paused cursors.
#+END_SRC

**** Customization
*evil-mc* can be customized in several ways:

- Every known command is executed using a command handler defined in a variable
  called ~evil-mc-known-commands~ in [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc/blob/master/evil-mc-vars.el][evil-mc-vars.el]]. Those can be overridden by 
  defining the ~evil-mc-custom-known-commands~ variable. See the documentation of 
  that variable in [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc/blob/master/evil-mc.el][evil-mc.el]] for more info.
- Some minor modes are incompatible with *evil-mc*. Those modes are defined in 
  ~evil-mc-incompatible-minor-modes~ and can be overridden by defining that variable.
- In addition there are two hooks that can be used to temporarily disable or enable 
  additional functionality while there are multiple cursors active
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  evil-mc-before-cursors-created
  ;; this hook runs just before the first cursor is created

  evil-mc-after-cursors-created
  ;; this hook runs just after the last cursor is deleted
  #+END_SRC

*** Notes
- Currently *evil-mc* is in a very early beta stage and thus not fully stable.
- Most evil motions and operators are supported but not every single command will work. 
- If the cursors don't seem to work during a command, either the command is
  not known (see ~evil-mc-known-commands~ in [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc/blob/master/evil-mc-vars.el][evil-mc-vars.el]]) or some minor modes
  could be interfering with the evil-mc operations. 
- Issues and pull requests are welcome. 

**** Debugging
- When a command does not work, and you want to get more information,
  you can enable (or disable) debugging by running any of the commands 
  below interactively.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (evil-mc-executing-debug-on)
  ;; Turn debug on while executing a command.

  (evil-mc-executing-debug-off)
  ;; Turn debug off while executing a command.

  (evil-mc-recording-debug-on)
  ;; Turn debug on while recording a command.

  (evil-mc-recording-debug-off)
  ;; Turn debug off while recording a command.

  (evil-mc-all-debug-on)
  ;; Turn all debug on.

  (evil-mc-all-debug-off)
  ;; Turn all debug off.
  #+END_SRC

**** Limitations
- After an undo command the cursors will return to their original positions
  if [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UndoTree][undo-tree]] mode is enabled and ~evil-repeat~ has not been used.
- Redo may cause the real cursor to get out of sync with the others.
  This can be worked around by setting a mark and returning to it after a redo.
- Jumps work if [[https://github.com/bling/evil-jumper][evil-jumper]] mode is enabled

**** Known issues
- Only named commands can be executed by the fake cursors.
- There could be a performance penalty when there are too many cursors (30+).
- Paste will not work when [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]]' paste micro state is enabled.
  This is due to the fact that ~evil-paste-pop~ and ~evil-paste-pop-next~ 
  commands are not supported.
- ~evil-repeat~ works only for some commands. 
  In particular it doesn't work for delete. It will also interfere with the 
  cursor positions during an undo or redo operation.
